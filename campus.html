	<h1>Vision for the new campus</h1>
	<p>CMR Universityâ€™s new 60 acre lakefront campus is located in North Bangalore, just off the Hennur-Bagalur Road. Developed as a greenfield project it is easily accessible from Bellary Road (New Airport Road) and well within BDA limits.

The state-of-the-art campus is being developed in a phase-wise manner as per LEED Green Building certification standards, and is designed by award-winning architecture firm CnT Architects. The proposed design features world-class amenities that include a residential zone with staff and student housing. The academic spaces are designed to encourage cross- disciplinary learning and interaction among students. International standard indoor sports complex and separate cricket, athletics and football grounds give students ample opportunities to train and excel in sports. The CMR University campus will also feature a variety of spaces for cultural activities that will be able to accommodate a range of audiences.</p>
